i18next is often used to enable multi-language support in your application. 
i18next helps you manage translations for your application. It allows you to define translations for different languages and provides a mechanism to switch between these languages dynamically.
With i18next, you can dynamically switch between languages in your React application without needing a page reload. 
i18next simplifies the process of managing translations in a React application by providing a clean separation between code and content.
